# Development
This is my development playground, and everything in it should be considered ALPHA at best.  

These are scripts that:
 - I need to quickly manipulate data for another piece of software or a human to ingest.
 - I wrote because I'm not familiar with how to use a language or complete a task, and I am simply interested in furthering my comprehension.
 - I need to provide an example or proof of concept.
 - I want to remind myself how something works in the future.
 - Are awesome and I don't want to forget exist.
